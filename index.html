		<h3>iPhone 13 battery might be smaller than iPhone 12, but with a vital charge feature</h3><br>

		<p>The iPhone 12 has only just been released and we're already hearing reports on its successor, the iPhone 13. We've heard two new rumors on future iPhones, though only one is explicitly linked to this 2021-model Apple smartphone.

		This first piece of news relates to the iPhone 13 battery capacity - as reported by 9to5mac - Ming-Chi Kuo, a respected analyst and Apple leaker, stated "we predict that iPhone 13 will be the first iPhone model to adopt battery soft board technology, which will help save internal space and reduce costs."

		Soft board technology for the battery is generally smaller than what's currently used in iPhones, which could help Apple in its quest to keep putting out small smartphones like the iPhone 12 mini, or just make the batteries higher capacity than what's currently in use. 

		Either way, this means if Apple was to keep the same battery capacity between its iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, the actual physical battery would end up smaller.</p>
